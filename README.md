"# Algo-hack" 

## Project Setup

To run this project Algorand sandbox should be up and running.

Required: Node.js, react, javaScript sdk, docker, and a app-id of your public address.

**Setting up algorand sandbox**

Docker should be running in the background.

   -  create a new directory: ex: ``mkdir algorand-sandbox``
   - cd into it: `` cd algorand-sandbox``
   - clone git repository:
   `` git clone https://github.com/algorand/sandbox.git ``
   - `` cd sandbox ``
   - ``./sandbox up testnet``

It will take some time to up, if successfully completed output will look like this.
